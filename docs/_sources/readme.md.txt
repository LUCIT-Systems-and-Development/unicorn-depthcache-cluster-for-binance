# UNICORN DepthCache Cluster for Binance (UBDCC)

A highly scalable Kubernetes application from LUCIT to manage multiple and redundant UNICORN Binance Local Depth Cache 
Instances on a Kubernetes Cluster for high-frequency access to Binance's DepthCache data (order books).

## Get a UNICORN DepthCache Cluster for Binance License

***Licenses will only be publicly available in the store in a few days. If you are interested in a free trial license, 
please [contact us via the chat](https://www.lucit.tech/get-support.html)!***

To run the *UNICORN DepthCache Cluster for Binance* you need a [valid license](https://shop.lucit.services/software/unicorn-depthcache-cluster-for-binance)!

## What is UBDCC?

The main idea is to deploy the UBDCC on a Kubernetes cluster with, for example, 4 rented servers. After transferring a 
valid license, you can create and manage DepthCaches within the cluster environment instead of on local servers and 
access them from multiple clients.

For example, when you configure the system to create 200 DepthCaches with a `desired_quantity` of `2`, UBDCC will deploy
2 DepthCaches for each symbol/market. These DepthCaches are evenly distributed across the nodes of the cluster and can 
download order book snapshots from the Binance Rest API using their own public IP addresses. On the first run, each 
server starts 50 DepthCaches, synchronizing the full set of 200 as quickly as possible. Afterward, replicas are 
initiated, with each node handling 100 DepthCaches.

[![Visual overview](https://lucid.app/publicSegments/view/7ba7d734-4bb2-467f-b7b9-74ea0d1deec2/image.png)](https://lucid.app/publicSegments/view/7ba7d734-4bb2-467f-b7b9-74ea0d1deec2/image.png)

## Key Features

- **Asynchronous Operation**: The entire cluster code is built to run asynchronously.
- **Load Balancing & Failover**: All requests for data (Asks/Bids) are handled via a load balancer with built-in 
failover, ensuring high availability and quick response times.
  - Local requests for Asks/Bids: ~0.02 seconds
  - Requests via the Internet: ~0.06 seconds
- **Flexible Data Retrieval**: You can trim the amount of transferred data at the cluster level, either by limiting to
a specific amount of top Asks/Bids or by setting a threshold.
- **HTTP Access**: DepthCache values can be retrieved through HTTP using both synchronous and asynchronous methods 
provided by 
[UBLDC](https://unicorn-binance-local-depth-cache.docs.lucit.tech/unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.html#module-unicorn_binance_local_depth_cache.cluster).
- **Top Performance**: The entire code base is deployed in the Kubernetes cluster as a compiled C-Extension!
- **Manages Binance Ceight Costs**: If the weight costs become too high, the cluster throttles the initialization.

## Current State

The first MVP is stable and offers the most critical features for efficient DepthCache management. Future improvements 
might include switching to websockets instead of REST queries, or implementing simultaneous queries for both Asks and 
Bids. [Vote here for new features!](https://github.com/LUCIT-Systems-and-Development/unicorn-depthcache-cluster-for-binance/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement)

## Installation

- Get a Kubernetes cluster with powerful CPUs from a provider of your choice and connect `kubectl`
- Install dependencies

```
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
```

### Helm Chart
- [Install Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install) 
- Prepare `helm`

``` 
helm repo add lucit-ubdcc https://unicorn-depthcache-cluster-for-binance.docs.lucit.tech/helm
helm repo update
```

- Install the UNICORN DepthCache Cluster for Binance

``` 
helm install lucit-ubdcc lucit-ubdcc/lucit-ubdcc
```

- Get the "LoadBalancer Ingress" IP, the default Port is TCP 80!

```
kubectl describe services lucit-ubdcc-restapi
```

#### Choose an explizit version
- Find a version to choose

``` 
helm search repo lucit-ubdcc
```

- Then

``` 
helm install lucit-ubdcc lucit-ubdcc/lucit-ubdcc --version 0.1.3
```

#### Choose a namespace
``` 
helm install lucit-ubdcc lucit-ubdcc/lucit-ubdcc --namespace lucit-ubdcc
```

#### Choose an alternate public port
``` 
helm install lucit-ubdcc lucit-ubdcc/lucit-ubdcc --set publicPort.restapi=8080
```
  
### Kubernetes Deployment
- [Download the deployment files](https://github.com/LUCIT-Systems-and-Development/unicorn-depthcache-cluster-for-binance/tree/master/admin/k8s)
- Apply the deployment files with `kubectl`

``` 
kubectl apply -f ./setup/01_namespace_lucit-ubdcc.yaml
kubectl apply -f ./setup/02_role_lucit-ubdcc.yaml
kubectl apply -f ./setup/03_rolebinding_lucit-ubdcc.yaml
kubectl apply -f ./lucit-ubdcc-dcn.yaml  
kubectl apply -f ./lucit-ubdcc-mgmt.yaml
kubectl apply -f ./lucit-ubdcc-mgmt_service.yaml
kubectl apply -f ./lucit-ubdcc-restapi.yaml
kubectl apply -f ./lucit-ubdcc-restapi_service.yaml
```

- Get the "LoadBalancer Ingress" IP, the default Port is TCP 80:

```
kubectl describe services lucit-ubdcc-restapi
```

## Security
In any case, you should set the firewall in the web interface of the Kubernetes provider so that only your systems 
have access to UBDCC.

If you want to do this, you can add HTTPS to the LoadBalancer with most providers.
  
## Uninstallation
```
kubectl delete -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
```

### Helm Chart
```
helm uninstall lucit-ubdcc
```

### Kubernetes Deployment
- Delete the deployment with `kubectl`

``` 
kubectl delete -f ./setup/01_namespace_lucit-ubdcc.yaml
kubectl delete -f ./setup/02_role_lucit-ubdcc.yaml
kubectl delete -f ./setup/03_rolebinding_lucit-ubdcc.yaml
kubectl delete -f ./lucit-ubdcc-dcn.yaml  
kubectl delete -f ./lucit-ubdcc-mgmt.yaml
kubectl delete -f ./lucit-ubdcc-mgmt_service.yaml
kubectl delete -f ./lucit-ubdcc-restapi.yaml
kubectl delete -f ./lucit-ubdcc-restapi_service.yaml
```
